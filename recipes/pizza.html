<p>Pizza crust, like <em>homemade bagels</em>, <em>artisan bread</em>, and <em>focaccia</em>, requires a lean dough. A lean dough doesn't use eggs or butter. Without the extra fat to make the dough soft, you’re promised a crusty pizza crust. (However, I recommend using some olive oil for flavor and to keep the interior on the softer side.) Recipes like dinner rolls, homemade breads ticks, and overnight cinnamon rolls require fat to yield a “rich dough,” which creates a softer and more dessert-like bread.</p>
